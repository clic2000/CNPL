Cooperative Non-Violent Public License v3 (CNPLv3)


License information and summary of purpose here: https://thufie.lain.haus/NPL.html

This license is itself licensed under a custom license encouraging derivatives with different names and allowing free use otherwise for the sake of allowing creative adjustments while avoiding confusion.

This license is based off of the [CSL](https://eunichx.us/c/) (Cooperative Software License) which is not actually just for software.

## Notes:

- Highly recommended to upgrade to version 3 or keep with the latest version. A critical typo was fixed from version 2.
